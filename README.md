# Parallel hyper-parameter optimization for loan default prediction
Official Python implementation for our Parallel hyper-parameter optimization for loan default prediction framework.

Hyper-parameter selection can significantly impact
the performance of the machine learning model. Due to the large scale of data, parallel hyper-parameter selection is necessary for practical applications. Compared with the widely-used grid search and random search, Bayesian optimization is a global wise method proposed in recent years with fewer iterations. We consider these three methods for hyper-parameter selection in their parallel implementations. In many real-world applications such as Internet financial lending, delayed loan review often hurts business efficiency, thus faster processing is required.
